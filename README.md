swehlos
=======

swehlos is an OS designed to allow me to play with [virtual] machines without
all that pesky c lib and other-peoples'-kernels nonsense getting in the way.
It's not intended for production, and there is no particular point to be
proven.

The initial files are taken directly from the [Bare Bones](http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) guide at OSDev.org. Many
thanks to all the contributors there for the resource that inspired me to
start playing with this stuff again.
